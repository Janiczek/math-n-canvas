What is this about?
===================
In this repository I'm just having fun with Math and HTML canvas element. I'm also using CoffeeScript just for the pure fun of it. Tips for new scripts always welcome!

Current scripts:

* phyllotaxis.htm
    * *Phyllotaxis*, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem. Can be used as a avatar creating tool ;)
    
* dragon.htm
    * *Dragon curve*, or, more precisely, Heighway dragon. Fractal defined by L-system.

* palettes.htm
    * *Animated HSL palletes*, quite self-explainatory :) changing *hue*, *saturance* and *lightness*.
